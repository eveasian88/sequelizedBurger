[Sequelized-Burger-Bar](https://hidden-hollows-63563.herokuapp.com/) is a Burger Ordering App using Node.js and Express Web Frameworks, Handlebars and Sequelize ORM. Users can custom order their individual burgers in the input field along with their names and then "eat it". The App logs all burgers ordered and eaten.
